# carbon-potential-australia
A geospatial tool built on Google Earth Engine to analyse soil attributes (CSIRO SLGA) and calculate a theoretical carbon sequestration potential score for project developers
# 🌱 Australian Soil Carbon Prospector

### Overview
This geospatial tool, built on **Google Earth Engine**, automates the site selection process for soil carbon sequestration projects. It aggregates data from the **CSIRO Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA)** to calculate a theoretical "Sequestration Potential Score."

### 🎯 Key Features
* **Custom Scoring Algorithm:** Weighted analysis of Clay (40%), Available Water Capacity (40%), and Soil Depth (20%).
* **Interactive UI:** Built-in dashboard for rapid layer switching and legend dynamic updates.
* **Granular Data:** Utilizes 90m resolution raster data for precise lot-level assessment.

### 🚀 Try It Live
You can run the tool directly in your browser without installing any software:
